# shakenfist-client

A {type,java}script client for interacting with Shaken Fist.

## Usage

Currently we export 2 clients

1. The "raw" client, which more or less directly maps to the Shaken
Fist REST API.

2. The regular client, which actually has entities with methods

## Limitations

For now, all that's supported is listing instances, as well as
starting/stopping/pausing them etc.
